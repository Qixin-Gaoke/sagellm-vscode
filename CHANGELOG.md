# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `.gitignore` 现在默认忽略本地 `.env` / `.env.local` / `.env.*` 配置文件，同时保留 `.env.example` / `.env.template` 模板文件可提交，避免扩展开发时误提交本地凭证。
- **Code block toolbar** — every code block in chat now has a toolbar with **Copy** and **Apply** buttons. Copy writes the code to the clipboard; Apply inserts it at the cursor in the active editor (or replaces the selection), or opens a new untitled document if no editor is active.
- **`write_file` tool** — the AI can now propose writing/creating files. A modal approval dialog is shown before any write, with a note on whether the file already exists. The written file is automatically opened in the editor.
- **`run_command` tool** — the AI can propose running shell commands. A modal approval dialog shows the command and working directory before execution. Output is returned to the model.
- **Slash commands**: `/model` (switch model), `/compress` (summarize conversation history to save context), `/help` (show available commands). `/clear` was already supported.
- **`/compress` context compression** — sends the current conversation to the model for summarization and replaces the history with the compressed summary, freeing up context window space for long sessions. Visual feedback shown in chat.
- **Updated hint bar** — now shows `/help for commands` instead of `/clear to reset`.

### Added (previous)
- **Rename: SageLLM → SageCoder** — display name, activity bar title, status bar, chat panel, all command titles, and extension description updated to "SageCoder". Internal `sagellm.*` config keys and command IDs are unchanged.
- **Extension description** updated to reflect code-generation-assistant positioning (inline completions, chat, explain/fix/test/docstring). Added `"Programming Languages"` VS Code category and `sagecoder`/`code generation`/`copilot` keywords.
- **Default system prompt** updated: model now introduces itself as "SageCoder, an expert AI coding assistant".

### Fixed
- **Standalone chat panel restored**: The right-bottom or command-triggered `openChat` panel no longer reuses the sidebar webview view type. The standalone panel now uses its own panel-only `viewType`, which avoids host conflicts with the working sidebar chat view.
- **Sidebar chat is now the primary conversation surface**: `SageLLM: Open Chat` now reveals the working sidebar chat instead of opening the fragile standalone panel, and the status-bar click opens the setup/configuration panel instead of the broken standalone chat window.
- **Setup panel is now actionable**: The status-bar panel is no longer a README-style page. It now shows current gateway/model settings and exposes direct actions for checking connection, opening settings, configuring the server, selecting a model, opening sidebar chat, and viewing debug logs.
- **Chat bootstrap flow hardened**: Sidebar and standalone chat now share a single TypeScript controller and a single HTML/script builder, and model-restore retries are cancelable and generation-scoped so later UI changes are less likely to break initialization.

### Added
- **Debug output channel restored**: `SageLLM Debug` and `SageLLM: Open Debug Logs` are available again for extension-side tracing while we reintroduce features incrementally.

## [0.1.12] — 2026-03-05

### Fixed
- **Model load failure / startup timeout**: Increased health-poll timeout from 60 s to 5 minutes (100 × 3 s) in both `startGateway` and `promptAndStartServer`. Model loading (especially with preflight canary + engine startup) routinely exceeds 60 s on CPU.
- **Double model loading → OOM**: The `sagellm serve` preflight canary (`SAGELLM_PREFLIGHT_CANARY`) loaded the model via `transformers` before the engine server also loaded it, doubling peak memory usage and startup time. The extension now sets `SAGELLM_PREFLIGHT_CANARY=0` in the terminal environment. The engine's own post-startup canary (`SAGELLM_STARTUP_CANARY`) still validates output quality.
- **Install guide wrong command and port**: Step 3 showed `sagellm gateway start --port 8000`; corrected to `sagellm serve --port 8901` (matching `SagePorts.SAGELLM_SERVE_PORT` and the extension's default). Port reference in step 4 updated from `8000` to `8901`.
- **Loading progress feedback**: Status bar now shows elapsed minutes every 60 s while polling so users know a long model load is still in progress.
